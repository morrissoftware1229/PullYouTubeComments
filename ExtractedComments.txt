1. I accidentally blew up my furnace with a bomb
2. i accidentally killed my ancient plant once. Immediately reseted the day
3. Me when I axe my first ancient tree
4. I did that but with ancient seeds
5. Everywon NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>Me: RELOD THE DAY
6. Pov: you bought the perfect amount of seeds. But you miss click and waste 1 . So you go to the store to buy another and either pierre is gone or you haven&#39;t got enough money...
7. Accidentally putting stuff in the trash...<br><br><br>Probably only happens to controller people
8. my worst misclick was accidentally gifting sebastian bait
9. What I really don&#39;t like about Stardew Valley is that on your first day, 15 seeds were given to you and you planted them in the garden and a day later a crow destroyed the harvest.The worst part is that you don&#39;t have enough farming level to craft a scarecrow
10. i disliked how willy goes out at 5 pm to fish in the docks. cuz that&#39;s also the time i would collect from my crab pots. so far though i&#39;ve only made a mistake two times, giving him Bait(gave him pumpkins for compensation anyways). I should prolly just remove the crab pots on that spot later.
11. this is so hilarious üòÇüòÇüòÇ
12. Omg this is so relatable o-o<br>But there is a solution! You can leave the world to go back to title screen, and go back on the world then the day resets<br>(Or mabey that&#39;s just Xbox)
13. I did that with my first ancient fruit...
14. Just got those who don&#39;t know, you can reset the day by just leaving to the title screen, this game only outo saves when you sleep
15. This is why i buy extra seeds
16. THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE ME SNORT AND CHOKE ON MY OWN SPIT BUT HERE I AM
17. I was talking to Emily on my first ever playthrough and got to the point where she was telling me about the parrots. At the time, I had my spelunking setup equipped, so I kept pressing the continue dialog button to hear more of what she had to say and, instead of hearing anymore of her thoughts, my character proceeds to shiv her like she was an inmate my farmer had beef with.
18. My picking the video with a gun on it was a misclick..
19. üòÜ I did this on console tonight, right after planting a hops trellis at, like, 8 at night. üòæ lol
20. When your pumpkins are finally gonna grow in the next day and you accidentally use a pickaxe on it and now you won‚Äôt have time grow a new one
21. Bro I have accidentally eaten and or sold SO FUCKING MANY things I‚Äôve wanted to keep/needed for the community center
22. Worst misclick is trying to talk to your spouse (or soon to be) just before you ask them to marry you and accidentally giving them slime or a rock. Maybe hitting no when asked about kids when you spent the last fortnight making a nursery.
23. I love accidentally bombing away 3/4 of my garden
24. a funny one would be when you go into sam&#39;s room and look in his trash he gets mad even if hes not in the room so its just a disembodied voice saying hey dont do that
25. tbh these animations were kind of annoying at first but theyve really grown on me?? idk<br>the evil farmer ones rub me the wrong way just a little but . it&#39;s true. I&#39;ll smack Harvey and Pam with a hoe idfc
26. insert <b>noot noot</b> here
27. I had this exact situation 7 times during my first playthrough of SDV. I lost so much money because i am buying cauliflower for my first crop since its the most expensive one. I didn&#39;t know that you can turned on tile indicator back then. It literally set back my farm a season worth of money, since i don&#39;t know that foraging can worth a lot of money, and the mine progress were gruelingly slow, and i finally managed to get a coop and upgrade all of my tools to iron during winter 14, with CC barely touched since i didn&#39;t know that completing bundle/room can give you reward.
28. can you not rip off joel art style...e
29. Dis face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1LdFUFFRBQ&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a>
30. Aaand there goes ancient fruit seed
31. Giving broken glasses to your futur soulmate.<br><br>Strong bad feeling but no virtual death unlike this
32. howdy pardner
33. I always accidently plant the last seed in the wrong place. It&#39;s just so triggeringüòµ
34. I accidentally pic axed my growing ancient fruit plant. (I only had two) so let me tell you I restarted that day SO FAST
35. i dont get the joke bc i dont have stardew<br>someone tell me what the joke is
36. I accidentally pickaxed one of my first ancient fruit plants 20 minutes before watching this, insult to injury XD
37. I need 450 wood to upgrade my barn, somehow I have 2 stacks with a total of 400 woods in my backpack, bought 50 from Leah, and tried to combine them both by left clicking, happened so fast I clicked both of my stacks, sold all of my wuds
38. She frowns, not because she destroyed the seed, but because she knows the consequences of destroying the seed. With this action, the thread of prophecy has been severed--the perfect balance of gold and energy has been overturned, and the hope of prime optimization has been torn asunder. The recourse is clear: The day must be done again. Her existence shall be snuffed, stripped from the record and forgotten, as another version of her, younger, untainted by her failure, shall move forward, to succeed where she failed. Though this incarnation shall carry on her memory and likeness, she knows that she herself must face the endless ennui of the void. Her time has ended, cut short by her own hand. And so, she frowns.
39. Thats why you hoe the entire area, then plant, then water.
40. I finally realized I should of been putting stuff in the cc a bit late into spring. I forgot to put in one pumpkin in the fall bundle, and I had just enough days left to grow one more. I forgot to guard it with a scarecrow üòî
41. I keep my tools in my backpack while I farm and then put the farming tools away after I‚Äôm done to go mining and stuff
42. Did that to the rare seed once
43. I swear I have never felt more indescribable pain in my entire life than whenever I pickaxe a seed or crop tile by accident.
44. Dat lawn flamingo tho
45. Having once done this to an ANCIENT SEED, i feel this pain on a spiritual level, granted i did have some spare seeds lying around so it wasn&#39;t that much of a loss but still, the ouch was there
46. I pick axed a fruit tree sprout
47. Oh Gosh, the lawn flamingo in front of the house is just perfect üëå
48. THE WORST. And it&#39;s always a vine or a bee flower.
49. RESTART THE DAMN DAY!
50. i always do this on wednesday...
51. I swear man I want to cry every time I misclick my warp home totem immediately after crafting it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶at home
52. Miss clicks  with the switch are so unforgiving. I‚Äôm using sad to rehab my thumb after surgery and it‚Äôs brutal when it happens lol.
53. First ancient seed gone forever
54. I just want to know why you did this art style and didn&#39;t credit the dude making it popular rn. Idk I feel like anyone who sees this art style on YT knows where it came from.
55. Needed a zoom with üé∂ hello darkness my old friendüé∂
56. miss click Pickaxe = disappointment.<br><br>miss clicking  a bomb = day ruined :(
57. Very strange cabbage in the background)
58. As someone who mines with mega bombs only. I&#39;ve maybe blown up acres of ancient fruits or whatever :)
59. Bro why did the fact that the pickaxe breaking the seed silencing everything made me laugh
60. There are few feelings I&#39;ve had worse while playing Stardew than:<br><br>A) Purchasing an iridium fishing pole just to accidentally drop it into the FUCKING ocean immediately after.<br><br>B) Having the final artifact I needed to get Gunther to give me the key to sewers so I could respec my farming bonus to get artisan only to accidentally give it away to Elliott who was also going to the museum (and BEHIND ME MIND YOU). Wasn&#39;t even facing the man and the game registered it as giving it away (he hated it btw).<br><br>Useful tip though: I got the last artifact from a worm pile, so after I restarted the day I just went back to that worm pile and found the exact same artifact. Thank you ConcernedApe for good game design.
61. God there will always be that one stunted plant cuz I CHOPPED IT INTO VALHALLA... whatever junimos problem not mine
62. this was me when I forgot that I had slime charmer + Napalm Ring combined and I thought I pressed an empty inventory slot but I had my hammer equipped and pressed left click so it killed all 50 slimes in my slime hutch and broke all the fences and flooring : ^)
63. This is the reason why I decided to keep all my tools in a chest and only take with me the ones I&#39;m going to use.
64. I blew up 2 chest full of important items by miss clicking a bomb, thankfully the game only saves at the start of the day because that mistake couldve been what ended my motivation to keep playing if I couldnt reset
65. hitting that ancient seed with a pickaxe be like
66. Restarting the day now
67. The pain. Yes I could just go buy another seed but now my crops won‚Äôt all mature at the same time so I‚Äôll just have to wait till I harvest then try again.
68. Does anyone know that moment when you want to talk to someone with the hoe still equiped and you think &quot;sorry I didnt mean to peel your face.&quot;? Or just me?
69. Almost as bad of a feeling as when you wake up on the 28. day of fall, expecting to get your last full harvest just to realize they all needed a day more and will rott away now
70. resets day
71. Pierre&#39;s is now closed.<br>That had to be planted today.<br>It was the last community center item.
72. Id imagine it was their last or only ancient seed and they didnt have a seed maker handy. Just judging from their reaction.
73. you forgot the loud ‚ÄúNOOOOOOO‚Äù at the end
74. What&#39;s psychopath plants crop in the order of hoe, seed, then water over and over???
75. Y&#39;all doing it one plant at a time?
76. That was it? That&#39;s your video?
77. The most painful thing is accidentally gifting something that you really needed to somebody üò≠
78. Atleast its not a fully grown crop
79. me when i accidentially pickaxed my brand new apricot tree
80. Hate when that happens...
81. it took me like a year to realise you could just use the pickaxe on tilled dirt to make it go away, so i would often times accidentally till dirt and just contemplate my existence for a few minutes
82. Her expression at the very end is peak perfection
83. I remember the time i accidentally gave haley a prismatic shard on her birthday when i was on my way to give the only extra prismatic shard i have to the museum. Gunther wasn&#39;t impressed by the daffodil i showed him that day.<br><br>Haley doesn&#39;t even like prismatic sharda üòî
84. lol been there many times myself
85. Yup.
86. I accidentally eat stuff all the time. Lost me some time to get cc...
87. ROFL! Perfectly conveyed, too. LIke, &quot;Here I am, playing this relaxing farming sim, with no worries in the...dear God, what have I done?&quot;
88. Blowing up a quarter of your hard earned starfruit seeds was a hell of a rollercoaster to me.
89. <b>Restart day</b>
90. Your mom is awesome at this :)
91. Took out a pumpkin exactly that way just today!  üò≠
92. ahhhhhhhh
93. i blow up my crafting table like 10 times a week
94. In all honesty, I hate it when the fairy or whatever else comes and screws up my plants growth cycle.<br>Like, thanks fairy! Now If I fill the whole field with seed they will grow at different paces and if I don&#39;t the field is no longer square!<br>I&#39;d sue the damn fairy for destruction of private property if I could!
95. New season starts, you buy the exact amount of seeds that you need from Pierre.<br>You go back to your farm and start working. Preparing the ground, crafting some fertilizer, placing it down, placing the crops, start watering...<br>Then, by total accident, this shit happens. You destroyed one crop. Now there is one less crop on your field... not only does it look like crap now because everything was perfectly symmetrical until that point - but it also kinda messes up your sprinkler layout. Or - if you use the watering can - the efficiency with which you can water the exact same amount of crops everytime you use it.<br>Sure, it&#39;s only one crop and you have the money to buy it again - but oh shit, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1LdFUFFRBQ&amp;t=16m40s">16:40</a> already. You won&#39;t make it in time because that lazy asshole closes shop at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1LdFUFFRBQ&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a>.<br>Yeah, you could buy it tomorrow but then you&#39;ll always have that ONE crop which finishes growing one day after ALL the other crops are ready.<br>So what do you do? Leave that spot empty? Plant a different crop? Plant the same kind of crop only one day later? SCREW THAT! It&#39;s all f*cked up now. You didn&#39;t sign up for this. All you wanted was some peace and quiet, escape the rat race into a virtual world where you are happy in your little community but ON HO, that&#39;s not possible either!<br>So that&#39;s when you quit the game, start drinking and beating your wife. With your newborn child.
96. every mistake like this earns an immediate day restart üò≠
97. I constantly accidentally drop a bomb in the middle of my shed filled with Mayo and cheese machines ;-;
98. CANCEL THE DAY
99. This is like the time I accidentally turned the crimson fish into sashimi
100. The character looks like my mom üò∞
101. Time to restart the day üôÑ
102. oh.. ok that;s not that bad.. i blew up a field of ancient fruits before
103. I legitimately misclicked to get to this video. I don&#39;t even know how I got here
104. You haven&#39;t felt true pain until you accidentally chop down the fruit trees you just bought
105. lost an ancient seed this way very sad
106. imagine that you pickaxed the only ancient seed you luckily got from your seed maker üòú
107. I&#39;m thrilled that you can include your family in these videos. That&#39;s good support right there.
108. This some AOT vibe. The slow thundering steps, the vacant smiling face? Must be some new gardener variety Titan
109. Am i the only one who clears out the land then waters then plants?
110. your mom is a great farmer
111. Lmao the flamingo is relatable
112. I hate when I missclick on the scarecrow because I love seeing the crows they run off stack up each season :(
113. So I didn&#39;t know hitting tab on PC changes your bars quick slot, and dropped a Mega bomb on my friends forges... oops
114. accidentally blew up my first crystalarium with a misclick bomb... had to wait AGES to get another one :(
115. This is even worse when planting rare seeds
116. What kind of insane person doesn&#39;t hoe the land before they plant everything
117. One time I axed my pomegranate sapling immediately after putting it down :(
118. At least you didn&#39;t accidentally bomb your crops? XD
119. I accidentally destroyed my house decorations because of a bomb :/
120. The thing that I‚Äôm most concerned about is how there‚Äôs a giant cauliflower in the background.
121. I somehow always have a pick/axe (either) selected in the middle of my ancient fruit crop in my greenhouse when I&#39;m checking my 1000 tabs on another screen and when I click back in the game it just automatically deletes one crop because of the tool in hand and it HAS TO DO THE MOTION WHEN I&#39;M CLICKING BACK IN THE GAME
122. I once found a mega bomb while mining, mistook is for a coffee bean, went to put it in the barrel, blew up all my mayonnaise makers, worm farm, not a single crop was spared. Thank god there‚Äôs no auto save
123. I&#39;ve given Willy so much seaweed by accident and I feel like I&#39;m the one who&#39;s gonna be thrown in his chum bucket the next time it happens
124. I too, wish for the call of the void whenever this happens.
125. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had to restart without saving after accidentally setting off mega bombs inside of my shed and destroying half of my equipment.
126. No bomb?
127. I did it to my first mahogany tree sapling lmao
128. 1. Save a shitton of money for mass seed buying on specific day<br>2. Go to the shop and mass seed buy<br>3. Mass craft fertilizer because you forgot to do it the day before<br>4. Panic till the land because it&#39;s not enough spaces/its uneven on one side<br>5. Water said tilled land<br>6. Put down fertilizer<br>7. Eat cheese cuz out of stamina<br>8. Plant seeds<br>9. Realize you bought 9 too many/not enough seeds for the full crop<br>10. Reset the game and redo all of that shit<br>11. It happens again, 2 more times<br>12. Turn game off for months
129. Hm :(
130. Every time I do a misclick I close the game and restart the day<br><br>Except for the time I accidentally gave Haley a piece of wood üòë
131. God... I have restarted so many days because of this. It&#39;s why I always water my plants at the beginning of the day if at all possible.
132. This missclick somehow open my third eyes
133. I know this pain.
134. Lirpa&#39;s TINY sigh at the end... &quot;hm&quot; üòî
135. you dont know how many times ive accidentally placed a bomb on my farm and cleared the entire screen for no reason
136. homie got the giant crops, horse and big house but can&#39;t make sprinklers
137. this is why you math how much you till and then just till all the plots, then plant all the seeds and finnish off by pickaxing all the seeds duh!
138. Broooo honestly the worst feeling
139. I finally got the mango tree from the tent on ginger island...and axed it just a couple days later üò≠
140. I know it‚Äôs a quirk of the rotoscoping, but I love how her eyes become smaller for a second when she realizes she‚Äôs messed up. It fits.
141. Yeah... i misclicked and pickaxed my ancient seed
142. that epic gamer moment when it&#39;s your one and only ancient fruit seed üëÅüíßüëÑüíßüëÅ
143. never leave bombs on the hotbar when farming....
144. shoutout to the time i managed to get an ancient fruit plant growing by summer of year 1 and then accidentally pickaxed it while i was trying to harvest the fruit
145. The most common misclick I&#39;ve had is when I plant flowers right next to my Bee Hives and go to collect Honey. I keep collecting the flowers instead. So much misclick pain.
146. What kind of psychopath plants by doing 1 hoe, 1 seed, 1 water instead of hoeing the entire field. Planting the entire field. Watering the entire field....
147. Never happened to me, i hoe an area then seed the area then water the area. Doing each plot just isnt efficient. If i have etxra plots oh well, more seeds doing another area. Gotta 100% the game in year one
148. Imagine it happens with your first ancient seed
149. OK but hoe it all. Then plant it all. Then water it all?
150. I&#39;ve accidentally destroyed the wrong crop on a few occasions due to a glitch, where i was putting in sprinklers on an empty bit of soil that I&#39;d accidentally tilled, but when I selected it to break it my character didn&#39;t move and broke the blueberry bush I had sitting right there
151. Bro just get 1 seed and wait to grow and get the fruit and take all the seeds and there you got seeds
152. How do people make these
153. What kind of sick bastard hoes and immidiately plants the seeds intead of hoeing the whole are the planting all the seeds?
154. Not quite as bad as accidentally selling your entire stack of seeds back to Pierre for half price seconds after just buying them
155. I swear this is my number one reason to restart a whole day
156. Me and my megabbombs at 10:50pm
157. &quot;just buy more.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>me who misclicked it 20 times<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>uhhuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</b>
158. pain
159. Rip that crop
160. worst misclick on ancient seed and its your only one xD
161. The real tragedy about this is not the misclick but the sheer inefficiency of constantly rotating 3 tools every soil patch when you should just in shovel, plant and then water them all in one go, this greatly reduces your chances of misclicking. Click smarter, not cycle through your inventory more like a chump.
162. I hate how I have physically typed nothing or said anything about stardew valley on my phone or near it, i acquired it Jan 31st and this is now in my recommendation, GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD
163. the worst part is when you pickaxe the first ancient seed you got that hadnt grown yet ( happened to me once and i havent forgotten)
164. Haha, and it&#39;s 5:40PM on a Tuesday, and there won&#39;t be enough time to grow it after wednesday.
165. RRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! <b>rage quits for 30 minutes</b>
166. oh my god i did that with a qi bean today
167. U got one ancient seed.. u pickaxe it!
168. Bombs are the bane of my misclicking existence
169. Ahahahaha, I do that ;(
170. That‚Äôs when you reset the day.
171. At least you didn&#39;t accidentally place a bomb right next to your pumpkin patch...
172. Your mom is such a G
173. My emotions when i lost the 39 omni geodes i had mined, because i decided to try and kill a whole horde of mummies
174. OMG I love these videos! So relatable
175. welp...<br><b>resets</b>
176. There a story I playing stardew valley and I plented 4 ban ben bon?I forgot Im not relly speek english so you know you cant walk in it so....I trepped myself
177. Aw they looked so sad
178. Not a misclick story, but I once got an item with a 0.13% chance of being dropped by a monster after a productive day. Then, I realized I missed a birthday, and instinctively went to restart the day WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE RARE ITEM.<br><br>I love you Linus, but your birthday gift was not worth a day restart :(
179. too many times.... way too many times.....
180. I screwed up alot worse than just with a pickaxe. I accidentally placed a bomb instead of a scarecrow in my garden.
181. Oh I did this one time! Except instead of using seeds I threw down a couple mega bombs ‚ò∫Ô∏èüî´
182. I just keep all my farming tools in one inventory row and all the minigh ones (including bombs and pickaxe) in another,,
183. For me it was when I accidentally threw my 4000$ coin sword in the trash and wasn‚Äôt able to get it back, I didn‚Äôt want to restart the day either because I had just planted so many crops and couldn‚Äôt handle redoing it, I went to sleep and saved before quitting
184. This  the kind of thing that makes me restart a day lol
185. I accidentally pickaxed one of my blueberry bushes last night :(
186. and u do it with ancient seed bros :))))
187. Suddenly the world went black, and went back in time to 6am
188. who else thought she was peeing
189. Bomb misclicks, feel like the ending of the Stardew world.
190. instant restart of the day...
191. Tell your mom I said hi! She did a great job.
192. Your mom is 100% my farmer avatar now.  Flawless.
193. not me accidentally putting a bomb in my crops üôÉ right after i went to skull cavern üôÉ
194. Did this to my ancient fruit treeü•≤
195. worst misclick is running around with a good item and gifting it to somebody when trying to get on your horse or into a door<br>AND THEN THEY HATE IT
196. should have been rare seed
197. I only needed the title to know the exact content and encapsulated pain of this video.
198. I just did that while clearing out coffee plants in my greenhouse to continue my AF farm. Really depressing hitting a fully grown AF plant.
199. What in the blue hell
200. I litearally started replaying stardew valley like two days ago
201. (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°) hm
202. FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT
203. I pickaxed my first ancient seed back when I was a super SDV noob........ only took about another in-game YEAR to get another one for some reason.
204. This is painful
205. I hate that, but I&#39;ve done it with bombs which is worse as if blows up multiple times. Usually after doing caverns then waking up at 6 AM right after to water my plants, having just used the bombs frequently in the mines they would still be in my hot bar
206. This happened to me the other day, except I accidentally scythed a hops plant and two pepper plants. It was midway through their growth phases too, so I couldn&#39;t really replant the pepper seeds or they&#39;d be out of sync
207. Welp, time to restart the game :&#39;(
208. the worlds greatest asmr
209. Thats some very very sad face :(
210. you know if your doing your farming first thing in the day and its something high value you could always quit and reload and the day restarts thus never losing your important crop.
211. Oh no! That hurts ;-;
212. I remember planting one of my fairy roses when I accidentally misc lick and I was like bruh and so I had to quit and come back to the game.
213. Imagine what this is like for someone who has no idea what happens in Stardew valley. Like me üò≠
214. THE PAIN, I FELT ALL THE PAIN!!!!
215. This happened to me with my ancient fruit, I was so stunned with my stupidity lol.
216. And thats why i deposit my pickaxe on a chest before planting things
217. When you misplace a fruit tree sapling On an otherwise perfectly aligned grid üíÄ
218. i would love to see animation cancelling in this style
219. So heart breaking. &gt;_&lt;
220. Is there a name for this style of non-animation?
221. When you pickaxe your single ancient fruit and it&#39;s already late in the day, so you have to restart and do the whole day again...
222. Deserved, what psychopath plants crops by hoeing dirt - planting - watering and then repeating, instead of doing all the hoeing, then all the planting and then all the watering
223. The worst is when you have just enough to have a neat shaped crop patch but you plant  the seed on that plantable ground you made by mistake earlier but didn&#39;t bother to remove with the pickaxe
224. Plot twist: it was an ancient fruit seed
225. Nobody like anymore
226. Welp, time to use my magic time god powers to reset an entire day.
227. <b>quietly restarts the day</b>
228. Remember the one time Gus asked me for a lobster and I got one the first day I set up my crab pots. I had it out and was carrying it to his saloon and right as I clicked on the door, Pam came out and I accidentally gifted it to her. It ended up taking me until the end of the year to get another one, and I restocked my 5 crab pots every day.
229. We need Lirpa in more videos. Thanks.
230. i once accidentally set off a bomb and it obliterated my community center trophy so i had to restart the day
231. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve watered everyone in Pelican Town at least once!
232. EM KILLDED A CORN!
233. I thought she peed on the garden bed üò¨
234. I too have the flamingo in my front yard ü¶©
235. Quality content right here. I like memes and Stardew, but this one came out a lil&#39; weak.
236. this happened to me right as i got my ancient seed
237. Should have dropped a bomb and blow up your paths and everything. That&#39;s what happens to me all the time because of my damn controler
238. I cant tell if this is the best or worst animation, Z has destroyed my sense of quality
239. &quot;That was my first and only ancient seed!&quot;   üòï
240. I was hoping the farmer would&#39;ve pulled out a bomb instead, I&#39;ve had to restart so many days accidentally pulling out bombs
241. Did this with my one sweet gem berry :(
242. Thank you, Farmer&#39;s Mom!
243. YouTube: How satisfied are you with this notification? Me: <b>weeping</b> Very satisfied.
244. Noooo you didnt make your dad the plant! <b>iykyk</b>
245. Imagine it&#39;s your first ancient fruit seed
246. YES !! more Stardew valley
247. this is just hell lol
248. What this didn&#39;t show is after the frown, quitting out of the game and redoing the entire day just to get that one click right.
249. I&#39;m sorry but Lirpa looks like Z in a blonde wig. Now I&#39;m curious to what would Z look like if he wore a blonde wigüë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
250. You managed to get ancient seed on a new file while fishing. But then you noticed that your inventory is full since you haven&#39;t upgraded your backpack yet. It&#39;s the third of spring on year 1 after all. You&#39;re in luck though. There&#39;s a trash. You get rid of it and then pressed ok. It took you a second to realized something. The ancient seed. You DIDNT put it inside. You cried for three hours
251. Bet it was an Ancient Seed too
252. ü§¨
253. The worst thing is when you finally find an ancient seed and then you hit it with your pickaxe
254. I feel that sooo hard
255. You should do one about the  backpack .. the stuff we keep in there üòÖ
256. I forgot to remove the Napalm ring when I killed the monsters in my farm at night... Took a min of grief before restarting the day all over again. üò≠
257. Almost as painful as picking up a Fairy Rose instead Honey from your neatly organized honey farm
258. Having the same buttons for giving gifts and talking to people was a mistake. The number of times I&#39;ve given a villager something that has great value to me but they hate is too much
259. And then it turns out that (closes and reopens the game) it was merely a bad dream!
260. Restart the whole day üòê
261. Nooooo
262. Your mom makes such a cute farmer. ^_^
263. Thought is a bomb for a sec but ok makes sense
264. i would be triggered if that was your last seed
265. Why is this so funny?!
266. coming home from mining in early morning and notice some crops are ready to harvest <br><br>and the fuck up happen<br>forgot that your using cherry bombs<br>while mining <br><br><br>watching it blow up an entire crop<br>make  you restart your last save which was the past day
267. This video came out as soon as it happened to me
268. not the frown at the end! ü•∫poor lirpa lol
269. Pls keep making these
270. Thank god I never misclick I just over water my crops a lot
271. YA YA!!<br>ITS REWIND TIME!!
272. Happened to me this evening with one of my strawberries üò≠
273. When it‚Äôs a rare seed or an ancient fruit seed
274. the horror in the farmers eye upon the realisation.. your mother is good at this
275. You go to Pierre&#39;s shop to buy a stack of seeds, as many as you can afford.<br>You then click on them to move them to another part of your inventory only to sell them ALL BACK FOR PENNIES!!!!
276. *Restarts day
277. I felt this in my soul
278. I be bombing the fuck outta my farm. Ive lost like 7 sprinklers.
279. Time to restart the day
280. If you are plowing, planting and watering each individual seed while constantly changing tools like that, yeah, you deserve that missclick.
281. NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
282. And there goes my perfectly calculated stamina usage per day.
283. Nice ancient fruit seed you&#39;ve got there. Shame if someone where to smash it with a pickaxe...
284. POV: you&#39;re planting your first and only ancient seed
285. Other day I had to restart a day because I put bombs down instead of seeds ToT
286. If you farm like this you&#39;re a sociopath
287. I always restart day when something like this happens. I know it&#39;s weak, but I just can&#39;t take it. My heart breaks too much, knowing the money I could be making but would miss out on now, or the bundle I had to fill that season that now wouldn&#39;t be filled. I just can&#39;t go through with it. I&#39;d rather redo the whole day multiple times and do it perfectly than fuck up monumentally and live it down. That&#39;s the beauty of video games that allow scumsaving üòÉ
288. I thought this was the worst misclick... until i married abigail and was trying to speedily click through our morning dialogue and we were outside and she gave me a cherry bomb and i didnt notice until i heard it get put down and start going... i tried to run but it was too late xD
289. guess, i&#39;m restarting the day
290. This is why i never keep my watering can next to anything that could destroy my crops. I always have it specifically set like this: axe, pickaxe, sword, scythe, watering can, milk pail, hoe, bait, fishing pole, food/gifts. That is the absolute perfect way to have your scroll bar set so you dont have to scroll too much to do any one thing so you dont fuck yourself up or end up wasting time scrolling too much when doing certain things
291. You missed the part where you restart the day cause you bought the exact amount of seeds for the spaces in your crop field
292. i found out about this channel thru this type of vids and when i finally saw what Zack really looked like....well.... it was a whole thing
293. It would of been better if you were watering a rock, not realizing it, and someone comes by and watches you water the rock.
294. God <br>That‚Äôs the worst
295. The worst is when you only buy just enough seeds for your field and it&#39;s 4:30 pm on a Tuesday
296. Welp, time to reset the day and do it all over again!
297. Or when you accidentally have a mega bomb in your hands üò≠
298. The size of that cauliflower Jesus christ
299. Clicks wrong button restarts the day over.
300. So many times I end up pouring my water the wrong way
301. The pain in the eyes...I feel it...
302. I think the worst feeling is when you pickaxe your grown potted cacti by accident... Done that so many times I can&#39;t-
303. Worst miss-click of me was accidentally clicking yes on drinking ancient fruit wine
304. eek
305. I got on YouTube, and resumed where I was watching a past stream and he was literally just talking about this idea and was like, &quot;I love that I hope he makes it&quot; and I go to his channel and üíóüíó
306. and you either brought to much or to little of the seed, thats why I like animals more because I can name them odd names or spawn stuff in
307. just from the title I knew what was coming
308. Me having flashbacks to the time I dropped a mega bomb in my chest room.
309. Ok, I know that&#39;s the watering can she&#39;s using, but it looks like she&#39;s lifting her skirts to pee on the crops. I cannot unsee.
310. Every psychopath that caves, plants and waters tile by tile deserves this
311. I&#39;m more baffled by the lack of fertilizer
312. It‚Äôs the flamingo in the back for me
313. no words are spoken but so much pain is felt
314. Great video! Hope to see more stardew valley content.
315. Why would you do it one by one? Just hoe it all at once, plant it all at once, and then water it all at once.
316. restart the dayyyyyyyyyyyy!!
317. Is this stardeq valley?
318. uhm <b>sad face</b>
319. I once accidentally blew up an entire shed that was full of preserve jars and wine caskets cuz I accidentally placed a bomb ü•≤
320. Wheeze.... these animations have me in stitches Z. Well worth hitting the subscribe button for these alone.
321. The pain is real.
322. This is a sketch that looks way less funnier on paper than it actually is.
323. Me when using the mouse scroll xD
324. For me it‚Äôs ‚ÄúGOD DAMN IT I WANTED TO WATER THE CROPS NEXT TO THE FAIRY ROSES, NOT PICK THEM, MY BEES WILL BE SAD‚Äù
325. I did that with my ancient fruit once. Had to restart the whole frickin day.
326. Another scenario:<br>you go to talk to a villager and accidentally hit them with your sword.<br>&quot;WH- WHAT THE YOBA WAS THAT?!?&quot;<br>&quot;Uh, sorry, I misclicked..&quot;<br>&quot;WHAT DO YOU MEAN, &#39;MISCLICKED&#39;! AND HOW DID THAT NOT KILL ME WHAT IS HAPPENINGGGG&quot;
327. At that point if I really need the seed, I just restart the day lmao
328. where was the instant day reset?
329. try playing on mobile, there is no axe safety on anything, my farmers a fukkn maniac with an axe in hand
330. just noticed the watering can noise sounds like my dog peeing
331. Z I swear to god
332. Always kills the vibe AND the plant...
333. I like to think the farmer went into autopilot and accidentally picked the wrong tool.
334. Yup, every time
335. Pain. Agony even.
336. I rly thought it was gonna be a bomb lol
337. i was expecting a bomb ngl
338. Pov: you wake up and leave your house to see your crops ready to be harvested. you run to harvest them and pause when you see your pickaxe slam into the crop, destroying it. You recall all the mining you did the night before and instant regret fills you as you contemplate restarting your day to preserve 1 crop
339. Time to restart the day again i see!
340. Thought it was going to be a mega bomb at first
341. Everytime you upload I wanna play Stardew! Thank you for helping me be productive in game üò≠
342. literally me, ive been anxious everytime im doing my dairy job thinking, dont fucking misclick oh god i dont want to start all again
343. My strawberries nooooo
344. Mis input! It was a misinput! Calm the fuck down!
345. Mom is perfect. &lt;3
346. POV : Its the first day of the season and you plant your mathematically calculated and organized crops at 6 PM, and then this happen
347. &quot;Whoops, here I go alt+f4-ing and restarting the day again...&quot;
348. I accidentally threw away a diamond i was going to give to krobus because i was trying to move it into my main inventory and i clicked on the trash :(<br>Happened more often with smaller scale items too, i really should slow down moving things in my inventory on the switch lmao
349. These animations are way funnier than I want them to be üòÇ
350. feeling when you cut a fruit tree
351. it always gives me anxiety when i see ppl collect crops with their tool set to the axe or pickaxe lol. its like seeing somebody dancing on the edge of a cliff.
352. Lirpa!! LOL
353. I feel P A I N
354. Ahahaha this is too relatable üò≠ Great job Lirpa!!
355. restart the day
356. A missclick
357. that one is up to hatching the fruit trees by mistake...
358. LETS GO LIRPA!!!!
359. I can&#39;t be the only person who was a bit confused on what that water noise was, right? Right...?
360. then you restart the day
361. Your mom did great!
362. I love how wholesome these are, thank you and your team for creating and sharing them &lt;3
363. Restart the day, immediately after sobbing
364. Hi yeah I did this to my rare seed on the 23rd day of fall ü•¥
365. Something like that sometimes happens to me with garden pots, i insta grab them to my inventory sometimes while picking up my pineapples
366. And that is why I alway keep my pickaxe on the opposite side of the hot bar from the rest of my tools.
367. also when u accidentally give something u need to a villager
368. :(
369. I thought this was gonna be about when you accidentally keep watering the same spot and then lewis catches him doing it and he just keeps doing it
370. *rushes to Pierre&#39;s cause it&#39;s 4:30 pm&quot;<br><br><br>and arrive at 5pm üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
371. One of the worst feelings in stardew
372. Just reset the day if you spare 10 minutes of your life to a game then how can you sacrifice your soul to your joja overlords
373. wait stop bc I have a flamingo in that exact same spot
374. hi
375. I love this!!!
376. The absolute pain on the players face lol
377. and on the ancient seed too
378. Welp , time to reset the day.
379. I thought this was the worst misclick that could happen in Stardew. Until I accidentally blew up all the rarecrows I had on display in a corner of my farm with a bomb... I had to take a moment to gather myself before restarting the day
380. This happens to me too much.. lol
381. And then you have to stop and consider whether you restart the day or if you‚Äôve done too much work that it‚Äôs not worth it
382. I can see the family resemblance in the eyes! Lirpa did a great job 11/10
383. I like how there is a big cauliflower behind and they don&#39;t even knowü§£
384. God the same happened with me and my axe and my coffee bean plants like a day ago
385. when you can see the family resemblance in a cartoon
386. What a pain. Lirpas expressions were on point
387. That&#39;s why I set my tools:<br><br>Pickaxe<br>Sword<br>Hammer<br>Axe<br>Scythe<br>Hoe<br>Watering Can<br><br>So if I hit watering can or scythe instead of hoe it doesn&#39;t mess anything up(except wheat, 10g/seed).
388. I hate switching to the pickaxe accidentally<br>It sucks so bad<br>Even if it‚Äôs a coffee bean
389. NOOOO MY CROP üò≠
390. We&#39;ve all had a &quot;been there done that&quot; moment.
391. Lirpa did a great job!! Perfect expressions! Great work!
392. i am from india bro
393. Bill I know your watching this video and you need to stop doing this
394. Was probably going to be the one thing you need for the CC, too.
395. This is great
396. My gf does this, I&#39;m gonna send her this so she knows what she&#39;s doing wrong<br><br><br>Stop doing it bill I cba to reset the day
397. lmao story of my stardew life
398. Happens far too often because I&#39;m always in a rush until I get those sweet, sweet iridium spranklers.
399. The worst feeling imaginable is when you buy a seed and then pickaxe it by accident. And then you realise you haven&#39;t got any money left to buy another one! :(
400. This is precious
